### Branches

 I use an agile continuous integration methodology, so the version is frequently updated and development is really fast.

1. **`Master`** is the development branch.

2. **`Production`** is the production branch.

3. No further branches should be created in the main repository.

**Steps to create a pull request**

1. Make a PR to `master` branch.
2. Comply with the best practices and guidelines e.g. where the PR concerns visual elements it should have an image showing the effect.
3. It must pass all continuous integration checks and get positive reviews.

After this, changes will be merged.
